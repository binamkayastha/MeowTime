# Routini

This is a routine on the pebble made for The Pebble Hackathon #002 which began
shortly after it was announced that the pebble was coming back!

Even though I bought a wearos watch, I kept finding myself going back to the
pebble because it has a long battery life (even after all these years, it still
lasts 3-4 days). Other smartwaches run out of battery and aren't able to do the
one main thing they're supposed to do - tell you the time. Dead battery tells no
time. Additionally:

* Since it didn't run out of battery quickly, I was less likely to forget it on the charger.
* The form factor made it easy to sleep with and use it as an alarm that doesn't disturb others.
* It had buttons so I could use it outside with gloves.
* It replaces a distracting phone and takes care of - telling time, setting alarms, doing pomodoro, and seeing notifications at a glance.
